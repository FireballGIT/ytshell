### How to install?
Since YTShell isn't a fully compiled project, you'll need to follow some steps.

1. Install Python 3(latest version works best, but any 3.x works)
2. Download the 1.0.0-beta ZIP or tar.gz file from GitHub: [github.com/FireballGIT/ytshell](github.com/FireballGIT/ytshell)
4. Set the directory: (WINDOWS): ```cd C:\Users\<user>\Downloads\ytshell``` (MAC/LINUX): ```cd ~/Downloads/ytshell```
5. Run this command: ```pip install pyinstaller```
6. Run this command: ```python -m PyInstaller --onefile --name ytshell run.py```
7. Double-click the file. It should open Terminal.

### What now?
As the terminal says, do ```$help``` to see the list of commands.
